Machine learning coursework for Applied Machine Learning Systems ELEC0134

Project aim : To develop multiple machine learning models for classifying images of brain tumors (2 binary models, one non-deep learning approach and one deep learning appraoch and one multi-class model) and tune the models to achieve "good" performance. 

The code is seprated into 5 files, each one is a seperate jupyter notebook (.ipynb). <br />
File 1 contains the code used to spilt that data into seperate folders depending on the image class.<br />
File 2 contains the code used to visulise the dataset.<br />
File 3 contains the SVM model - this inlcudes pulling in the data from the folders and fitting the model.<br />
File 4 contains the binary deep learning model - this includes pulling the the data and training the model.<br />
File 5 contains the multi-class deep learning model - this includes pulling the the data and training the model.<br />

Each file can be ran independently, all required modules are listed at the end of this file.
